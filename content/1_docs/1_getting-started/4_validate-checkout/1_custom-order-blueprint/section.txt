Title: Custom Order Blueprint

----

Abstract:

----

Text:

You can copy the default (link: docs/blueprints/pages/order text: order blueprint) or start from scratch. Add your own fields and add the validation options you like.

### Example

Letâ€™s assume you need a *given name* which has to have at least two characters but at the most three words.

(filename: site/blueprints/pages/order.yml)

```yaml
title: Order

fields:
  givenName:
    type: text
    required: true
    validate:
      minLength: 2
      maxWords: 3
```

```php
$merx->initializePayment([
  'givenName' => 'Elizabeth Alexandra Mary',
]); // ok

$merx->initializePayment([
  'givenName' => 'Karl-Theodor Maria Nikolaus Johann Jacob Philipp Franz Joseph Sylvester',
]); // not ok (throws Exception)
```
