Text: 

To make sure you get all the data you need from your customers, Merx uses Kirby’s page validation. You can define the required fields and set `validate` options for each field you want to validate. See (link: https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/system/validators text: Kirby’s documentation) for all available validators.

You don’t have to check if the customers cart is valid.
