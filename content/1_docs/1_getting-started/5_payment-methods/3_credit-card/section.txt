Text:

**This payment method shouldn’t be used. It requires an older Stripe API and doesn’t support [Strong Customer Authentication (SCA)](https://stripe.com/de/guides/strong-customer-authentication) which is required in the European Union. You should use [`credit-card-sca`](#credit-card-sca) instead.**

With Stripe’s Credit Card integration, your customers can pay without leaving the website. You need to integrate Stripe’s (link: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-js/elements/quickstart text: Card Element) to get a stripeToken which you have to provide for `initializePayment`.

### Initialize Payment

```php
$redirect = $merx->initializePayment([
  'paymentMethod' => 'credit-card',
  'stripeToken' => 'tok_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'
]);
go($redirect); // /success
```

### Complete Payment

You don’t have to provide any additional information for the `completePayment` method.
