### Initialize Payment

```php
$redirect = $merx->initializePayment([
  'paymentMethod' => 'sofort',
]);
go($redirect); // https://www.sofort.com/payment/â€¦
```

You are redirected to *klarna.com* where the customer has to accept the payment.

### Complete Payment

The redirect url has several get parameters. Use the `source` parameter for the `completePayment` method.

(filename: site/templates/success.php)

```php
$source = get('source'); // src_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
$merx->completePayment([
  'source' => $source,
]):
```
