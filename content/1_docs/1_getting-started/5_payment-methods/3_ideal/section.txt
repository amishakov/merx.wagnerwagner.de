### Initialize Payment

```php
$redirect = $merx->initializePayment([
  'paymentMethod' => 'ideal',
]);
go($redirect); // customerâ€™s banking website
```

iDEAL redirects customers to their online banking environment to authenticate a payment using a second factor of authentication. There is immediate notification about the success or failure of a payment. The exact customer experience depends on their bank.

(filename: site/templates/success.php)

```php
$paymentIntent = get('payment_intent'); // pi_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

$merx->completePayment([
  'payment_intent' => $paymentIntent,
]);
```
