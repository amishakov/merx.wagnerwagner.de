Title: Securing Order Pages

----

Abstract: Order pages may contain sensitive personal data from your customers. Make sure to secure these personal information.

----

Text:

### Basic

- Do not show personal information when it is not necessary.
- Make sure order page links don’t appear in a sitemap or similar list of pages.
- Add a robots meta tag to prevent search engines to crawl order pages. 
`<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">`
- Add a `robots.txt` to disallow order pages. (Your `/orders/` path can be different depending on your [ordersPage option](/docs/options#orderspage))
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /orders/
```

### Advanced

- Prevent the use of `$orderPage->siblings()` or similar.
- If you use a page search: Make sure order pages are not searchable.
- If you use git: Make sure order pages are not included in your (public) git repository.

### Further considerations

- Only show the order page with a valid hash as [suggested by @bruno](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/merx-plugin-to-create-online-shops-with-kirby-3/13735/128).
- Create a log entry each time a OrderPage is rendered. You could overwrite the `OrderPage::render()` method.
- Add a method to detect/prevent brute force attacks.
- Only send one time, hashed order page links, which are only valid for a short period of time. (self destroying link)
- ”Deactivate“/“Unplublish” the order page after a short period of time as [suggested by @Philip](https://forum.getkirby.com/t/merx-plugin-to-create-online-shops-with-kirby-3/13735/131).
