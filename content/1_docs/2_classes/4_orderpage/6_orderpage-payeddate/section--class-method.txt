Summary:

Text: Since (link: https://github.com/wagnerwagner/merx/releases/tag/v1.7.0 text: Merx 1.7), the date when the payment of an order is completed is no longer stored in the `payedDate` field. Instead, it is stored in the `paidDate` field. This method returns the `payedDate` field (for orders before Merx 1.7) or the `paidDate` field.
