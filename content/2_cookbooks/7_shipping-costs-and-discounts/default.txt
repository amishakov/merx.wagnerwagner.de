Shortdescription: How to use a hook to manipulate the cart.

----

Text:

With Merx 1.1 there is a new hook called [`ww.merx.cart`](/docs/hooks/cart) which gives you the capability to manipulate the cart. You can add new products (e.g. *Shipping*). You could even change the price of products in the cart with [$cart->updateItem()](docs/classes/cart/updateitem).

Find the source code of a full working example on Github:
