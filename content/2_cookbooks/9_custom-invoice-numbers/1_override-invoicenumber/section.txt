Title: Override invoiceNumber()

Text:

You can override the default [`invoiceNumber()`](/docs/classes/orderpage/invoicenumber) method to return *for example* a content field. In this example the content of invoiceNumber field is returned.

(filename: site/models/order.php)

``` php
<?php
class OrderPage extends OrderPageAbstract
{
  public function invoiceNumber(): string
  {
    return $this->content()->invoiceNumber()->toString();
  }
}
```

Be careful, the `invoiceNumber()` method has to return a `string`.
