Shortdescription: Override the default invoiceNumber method.

Text:

By default the invoice number is generated by the page number.
[`$orderPage->invoiceNumber()`](/docs/classes/orderpage/invoicenumber)

You can override this method to use a custom field.
To update the field a custom hook can be used.
