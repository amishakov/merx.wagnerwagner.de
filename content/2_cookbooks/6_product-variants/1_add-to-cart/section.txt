Title: Add to cart

----

Abstract:

Text:

Add the desired variations to the customer’s (link: docs/classes/cart text: cart). That’s it.

```php
$cart->add([
  'id' => 'nice-shoes',
  'key' => 'nice-shoes-abc',
  'color' => 'red',
  'size' => 38,
]);
```

You can even set a custom price within the add method:

```php
$cart->add([
  'id' => 'nice-shoes',
  'key' => 'nice-shoes-xyc',
  'color' => 'gold',
  'size' => 41.5,
  'price' => 249.99,
]);
```

Tax is calculated automatically based on the tax value (link: docs/getting-started/add-products/content text: defined in the product page).

If you add the same product to the cart, the cart item will be merged/overwritten by default (the quantity is added up). To add more than one variant of a product to the cart, you have to set a unique `key` for each variant.
