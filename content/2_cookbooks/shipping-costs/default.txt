With Merx 1.1 there is a new hook called `ww.merx.cart` which gives you the capability to manipulate the cart. You can add new products (e.g. *Shipping*). You could even change the price of products in the cart with [$cart->updateItem()](docs/classes/cart/updateitem).

You can find the source code of a full working example on Github:
