## About this Agreement
While Merx's source code is publicly available, Merx is **not free**. To use Merx on a public server, you need to purchase a (link: buy text: license).

This End User License Agreement (the **"Agreement"**) is fundamental to the relationship between you and us. Therefore we recommend to read this Agreement carefully before you download, install or use Merx.

Merx is a plugin for Kirby CMS. Please also note (link: https://getkirby.com/license text: Kirbyâ€™s End User License Agreement).

If you do not agree to this Agreement, please do not download, install or use Merx. Installation or use of Merx signifies that you have read, understood, and agreed to be bound by this Agreement.

This Agreement was last revised on March 27, 2019.

## Definitions
Terms that will be used throughout the Agreement:

- When we refer to **"You"**, we mean the licensee. Before purchasing Merx, that's the individual or company that has downloaded and/or installed Merx on a Development Machine. The licensee of a Public Site is the individual or company that has purchased the Merx license. If you work on a client project and have purchased the Merx license for your client, you (and *not* the client) are the licensee.
- When we refer to **"We"**/**"Us"**/**"Our"**, we mean the Wagnerwagner GmbH. You can find our company and contact information on our (link: contact text: contact page).
- A **"Website"** is a single Kirby project that is defined by its domain name and root directory (e.g. `https://sub.example.com` or `https://example.com/example/`). Each (sub)domain and root directory is a separate Website, even if the projects are related in any way. If the same Kirby *multi-language installation* spans multiple domains, these domains count as the same Website.
- A **"Development Machine"** is a computer that is used to work on a Website (like a desktop PC, notebook or tablet). It can also be a server that is only accessible by a restricted number of users (like in an intranet or when protecting a staging website with a password that only a restricted number of users know).
- A **"Public Site"** is a Website that is installed on a computer/server that does *not* qualify as Development Machine and is *not* an Extension Demo.
- An **"Update"** is defined as a Merx release which adds smaller new features, minor functionality enhancements or bug fixes. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the right of the first decimal point, e.g. 1.1 to 1.2 or 1.X.1 to 1.X.2.
- An **"Upgrade"** is a major Merx release which incorporates major new features or enhancements that increase the core functionality of Merx to a larger extent. This class of release is identified by the change of the revision to the left of the first decimal point, e.g. 1.X to 2.0. Whether a release is an Update or Upgrade is at Our sole discretion.
- The **"Source Code"** is defined as the contents of all files that are provided with Merx and that make Merx work. This includes (but is not limited to) all PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS files as well as all related image and other media files.

Every time you see one of these capitalized terms in the following text, it has the meaning that has been explained above.

## Usage for a Public Site
Installing Merx on or using it for a Public Site requires a (link: buy text: paid license).

As Merx is software and software is intangible, we don't sell it as such. Instead, this Agreement grants a license for each purchase to install and use a single instance of Merx on a **specific Website**. Additional Merx licenses must be purchased in order to install and use Merx on **additional Websites**.

The license is **non-exclusive** (meaning that You are not the only one who We will issue a license) and **generally non-transferable** (meaning that the one who purchases the license is the licensee).

If you need to **transfer** your Merx license to another individual or company, please get in touch directly at (email: support@getkirby.com).

A license is valid for all Updates of the same major Merx release. We reserve the right to charge an **upgrade fee for Upgrade releases**.

## Free licenses

We believe that it should be possible to test and evaluate software before having to purchase a license. Also, we understand that a web project first needs to be built in a protected environment before it can be published.

Therefore, installing and using Merx on a Development Machine is **free** for as long as You need.
